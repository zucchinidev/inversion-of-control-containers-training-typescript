# Inversion of Control with TypeScript and InversifyJS

A basic example that showcases how to setup InversifyJS

To run this example you need to install some dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```
And compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript code:

```
$ npm start
```

The generated code is available at the `dist` directory.

At this point you are ready to run the example:

```
$ node dist/main.js
```

You should see the following in console:

```
